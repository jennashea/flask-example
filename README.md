### Task:
Create a basic Flask web application:

- Root / is not important :)
- /<int:number> will display integers from 1 to that number
- /<int:number>/odd will display only odd numbers in that range
- /<int:number>/even will display only even numbers in that range
- /<int:number>/prime will display only prime numbers in that range

There are many ways to achieve this, I just want to see how you would approach the problem.
Feel free to show multiple ways but you can also just leave one which is the best in your opinion.
Consider performance and scalability.

This will give us a base to talk about and maybe remove need to ask certain questions entirely.
Extra points for creating a Dockerfile.
